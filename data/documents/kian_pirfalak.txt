Kian Pirfalak (Persian: کیان پیرفلک; 11 June 2013 – 16 November 2022) was an Iranian child who was killed at the attack on Izeh market, in a shooting by government security forces while he sat in his parent's vehicle in the city of Izeh, Iran.[2][3][4] His father Meysam Pirfalak was also critically injured in the assault and was hospitalized.[5][6] His mother and other family members who witnessed the incident blame the attack on Iranian security forces.[7] Islamic Republic news agencies, including IRNA, blamed his death on terrorists, circulating a statement attributed to ISIS, alleging that the group has claimed the deadly shooting that killed him.[8] BBC Monitoring, however, investigated the statement and concluded that it was fake.[9]

Pirfalak’s death sparked a nationwide outrage against the government and its use of extreme lethal force against protestors.[10][11][12] He is considered the youngest known victim (either 9 or 10-years old) of suppressing the Mahsa Amini protests.[10][13][14]
